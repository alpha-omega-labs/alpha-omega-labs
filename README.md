## **TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

THE FOLLOWING OPEN SOURCE CODES AND IDEAS, AND ITS IMPLEMENTATIONS WITH OPEN SOURCE CODES ARE STRICTLY EXPERIMENTAL AND POSES ONLY THE VALUE OF EXPERIMENT BY DEFAULT. 
AS IN ANY EXPERIMENT, RESULTS MAY BE UNPREDICTABLE, AND AS ANY EXPERIMENTAL SOURCE CODE, IT MAY CONTAIN SO CALLED BUGS AND CODE ERRORS. 

DON'T USE THE FOLLOWING OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE UNLESS YOU WANT TO EXPERIMENT WITH IDEAS, CODES AND ARTS. 

## **EXPERIMENT**

IMPLEMENT NEW GENERAL SCALABLE, HIGH-THROUGHPUT DECENTRALIZED LAYER 1 BLOCKCHAIN WITH FAST TRANSACTION FINALITY, ETHEREUM EVM & WEB3 COMPATIBILITY, FOR RUNNING ART (NFT) AND GAMES DAPPS, SCIENTIFIC DAPPS & OTHER DAPPS.

## **PROCESS AND METHODS**

 1.  "GENESIS" SNAPSHOTS OF TWO DIFFERENT ERC-20 TOKENS WITH DECENTRALIZED DISTRIBUTION (DMT & DKUMA).  
 2. RANDOM & FAIR SELECTION OF "GENESIS" SNAPSHOTS BASED ON NUMBERS IN ETHEREUM BLOCK HASHES.
 3. "GENESIS" ERC-20 TOKEN DISTRIBUTION TO RANDOM SELECTED "GENESIS" SNAPSHOT. 

- ETHERMINT FORK FOR OPEN TESTNET BLOCKCHAIN ESTABLISHMENT.
- ETHERMINT FORK FOR OPEN MAINNET BLOCKCHAIN ESTABLISHMENT.
- "GENESIS" TOKEN DISTRIBUTION OR/AND BRIDGE TO THE MAINNET.  

## **"GENESIS" TOKEN**

+ 21M TOKENS, AS A NUMBER CHOSEN BY SATOSHI NAKAMOTO.
+ 10M TOKENS TO DMT RANDOMLY SELECTED SNAPSHOT.
+ 10M TOKENS TO DKUMA RANDOMLY SELECTED SNAPSHOT.
+ 1M TOKENS TO MULTISIG WALLET OF BOTH TOKEN COMMUNITIES.

## **NOTES**

+ DMT COMMUNITY REPRESENTS DIGITAL ARTISTS, CREATORS AND MEDIA PROFESSIONALS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE IN ETHEREUM ENVIRONMENT AND NFT PRODUCTION.
+ DKUMA COMMUNITY REPRESENTS AVERAGE USER OF ETHEREUM, WHERE BLOCKCHAIN IS USED FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES, INCLUDING RECREATIONAL VIEW OF NFT.
 
**1. "GENESIS" SNAPSHOTS OF TWO DIFFERENT ERC-20 TOKENS WITH DECENTRALIZED DISTRIBUTION (DMT & DKUMA)**  
+ "GENESIS" SNAPSHOTS WILL BE PERFORMED ON DIFFERENT ETHEREUM BLOCK HEIGHT. 
+ SNAPSHOTS AND SCRIPT FOR GETTING RESULTED SNAPSHOTS WILL BE OPEN SOURCED.

**2. RANDOM & FAIR SELECTION OF "GENESIS" SNAPSHOTS BASED ON NUMBERS IN ETHEREUM BLOCK HASHES**
+ EACH SNAPSHOT WILL HAVE A NUMBER ASSIGNED TO IT STARTING FROM ONE (1), WITH EQUAL QUANTITY OF ODD AND EVEN NUMBERS ASSIGNED.
+ SOME RANDOM ETHEREUM BLOCK HEIGHTS, THAT IS NOT YET EXIST AT THE TIME OF SNAPSHOT.
+ NUMBER ASSIGNATION WILL BE CHOSEN AND THIS BLOCK HEIGHTS WILL BE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED BEFORE IT OCCUR.
+ WHEN CHOSEN ETHEREUM BLOCK HEIGHTS OCCURS, THE FIRST NUMBER THAT APPEARS IN CHOSEN ETHEREUM BLOCK HASH WILL BE COMPARED WITH NUMBERS ASSIGNED TO "GENESIS" SNAPSHOTS:
+ IF ODD NUMBER IS THE FIRST NUMBER IN ETHEREUM BLOCKHASH ON CHOSEN HEIGHT - ONLY SNAPSHOTS WITH ASSIGNED ODD NUMBER WILL PROCEED TO THE NEXT ROUND OF NUMBER ASSIGNATION AND RANDOM SELECTION. 
+ IF EVEN NUMBER IS THE FIRST NUMBER IN ETHEREUM BLOCKHASH ON CHOSEN HEIGHT - ONLY SNAPSHOTS WITH ASSIGNED EVEN NUMBER WILL PROCEED TO THE NEXT ROUND OF NUMBER ASSIGNATION AND RANDOM SELECTION.
