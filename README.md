<strong>Ethermint and Evmos fork! Currently running on Evmos v0.3</strong>

GenesisL1 blockchain project is a planned, highly experimental, Cosmos SDK and Ethereum EVM (Ethermint engine) powered Layer 1 blockchain made for Arts (NFT) and in silico research methods and bioinformatics, using blockchain as a distributed, decentralized database and storage for Open distributed Art and Scientific databases.  

GenesisL1 blockchain is powered by L1 coin. All initial supply of 21M coins was gifted valueless to users and onchain community_pool to fulfill 3 core features and utilities of L1 coin and 2 core applications of L1 coin:

I. Applications:

+ recycle L1 coin on blockchain, 1L1 = 1L1
+ utilize L1 coin on blockchain, 2L1 = 2L1 

II. Utilities:

+ protecting blockchain/network and consensus
+ voting on SIGANL, COMMUNITY_POOL SPENDING, BLOCKCHAIN PARAMS CHANGE proposal
+ powering smart contracts with gas 

L1 coin may be requested from GenesisL1 community_pool by anyone (validator, developer, artist, scientist, user, group, project, etc) with proposal to fulfill core utilities, features and applications of L1 coin. 

ITS AN EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE AND IDEAS, AND ITS IMPLEMENTATIONS. NO WARANTY OF ANY KIND! IT MAY NOT WORK OT MAY HAVE ERRORS AND BUGS. ITS VOLUNTARY AND OPEN SOURCE.

CHAIN A BIT HALTED NOW DUE TO WRONG UPDATE ATTEMPT, RECOVERING TO THE NEW VERSION OF SDK BY FORKING CRONOS, HELP APPRECIATED!
