## **TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

THE FOLLOWING OPEN SOURCE CODES AND IDEAS, AND ITS IMPLEMENTATIONS WITH OPEN SOURCE CODES ARE STRICTLY EXPERIMENTAL AND POSES ONLY THE VALUE OF EXPERIMENT BY DEFAULT. 
AS IN ANY EXPERIMENT, RESULTS MAY BE UNPREDICTABLE, AND AS ANY EXPERIMENTAL SOURCE CODE, IT MAY CONTAIN SO CALLED BUGS AND CODE ERRORS. 

DON'T USE THE FOLLOWING OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE UNLESS YOU WANT TO EXPERIMENT WITH IDEAS, CODES AND ARTS. 

## **EXPERIMENT**

IMPLEMENT NEW GENERAL SCALABLE, HIGH-THROUGHPUT DECENTRALIZED LAYER 1 BLOCKCHAIN WITH FAST TRANSACTION FINALITY, ETHEREUM EVM & WEB3 COMPATIBILITY, FOR RUNNING ART (NFT) AND SCIENCE DAPPS.

## **PROCESS AND METHODS**

 1.  "GENESIS" SNAPSHOTS OF TWO DIFFERENT ERC-20 TOKENS WITH DECENTRALIZED ALLOCATION (DMT & DKUMA).  
 2. RANDOM & FAIR SELECTION OF "GENESIS" SNAPSHOTS BASED ON NUMBERS IN ETHEREUM BLOCK HASHES.
 3. "GENESIS" ERC-20 TOKEN ALLOCATION TO RANDOM SELECTED "GENESIS" SNAPSHOT. 

- ETHERMINT FORK FOR OPEN TESTNET BLOCKCHAIN ESTABLISHMENT.
- ETHERMINT FORK FOR OPEN MAINNET BLOCKCHAIN ESTABLISHMENT.
- "GENESIS" TOKEN ALLOCATION OR/AND BRIDGE TO THE MAINNET.  

## **"GENESIS" TOKEN**

+ 21M TOKENS, AS A NUMBER CHOSEN BY SATOSHI NAKAMOTO.
+ 10M TOKENS TO DMT RANDOMLY SELECTED SNAPSHOT, PART TO "CREATORS" GIFTS.
+ 10M TOKENS TO DKUMA RANDOMLY SELECTED SNAPSHOT, PART TO "CREATORS" GIFTS.
+ 1M SCI QUEST.

## **NOTES**

+ DMT COMMUNITY REPRESENTS DIGITAL ARTISTS, CREATORS AND MEDIA PROFESSIONALS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE IN ETHEREUM ENVIRONMENT AND NFT PRODUCTION.
+ DKUMA COMMUNITY REPRESENTS AVERAGE USER OF ETHEREUM, WHERE BLOCKCHAIN IS USED FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES, INCLUDING RECREATIONAL VIEW OF NFT.
 
**1. "GENESIS" SNAPSHOTS OF TWO DIFFERENT ERC-20 TOKENS WITH DECENTRALIZED ALLOCATION (DMT & DKUMA)**  
+ "GENESIS" SNAPSHOTS WILL BE PERFORMED ON DIFFERENT ETHEREUM BLOCK HEIGHT. 
+ SNAPSHOTS AND SCRIPT FOR GETTING RESULTED SNAPSHOTS WILL BE OPEN SOURCED.

**2. RANDOM & FAIR SELECTION OF "GENESIS" SNAPSHOTS BASED ON NUMBERS IN ETHEREUM BLOCK HASHES**
+ EACH SNAPSHOT WILL HAVE A NUMBER ASSIGNED TO IT STARTING FROM ONE (1), WITH EQUAL QUANTITY OF ODD AND EVEN NUMBERS ASSIGNED.
+ SOME RANDOM ETHEREUM BLOCK HEIGHTS, THAT IS NOT YET EXIST AT THE TIME OF SNAPSHOT.
+ NUMBER ASSIGNATION WILL BE CHOSEN AND THIS BLOCK HEIGHTS WILL BE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED BEFORE IT OCCUR.
+ WHEN CHOSEN ETHEREUM BLOCK HEIGHTS OCCURS, THE FIRST NUMBER THAT APPEARS IN CHOSEN ETHEREUM BLOCK HASH WILL BE COMPARED WITH NUMBERS ASSIGNED TO "GENESIS" SNAPSHOTS:
+ IF ODD NUMBER IS THE FIRST NUMBER IN ETHEREUM BLOCKHASH ON CHOSEN HEIGHT - ONLY SNAPSHOTS WITH ASSIGNED ODD NUMBER WILL PROCEED TO THE NEXT ROUND OF NUMBER ASSIGNATION AND RANDOM SELECTION. 
+ IF EVEN NUMBER IS THE FIRST NUMBER IN ETHEREUM BLOCKHASH ON CHOSEN HEIGHT - ONLY SNAPSHOTS WITH ASSIGNED EVEN NUMBER WILL PROCEED TO THE NEXT ROUND OF NUMBER ASSIGNATION AND RANDOM SELECTION.

**3. "GENESIS" ERC-20 TOKEN DISTRIBUTION TO RANDOM SELECTED "GENESIS" SNAPSHOT**

## **TIMELINES**

+ "GENESIS" SNAPSHOTS: AUG 2021
+ "GENESIS" GAME: SEP 2021
+ "GENESIS" ALLOCATION: SEP 2021
+ OPEN TESTNET: SEP 2021
+ OPEN ALPHA MAINNET: SEP 2021 - FEB 2022


## **SNAPSHOTS SPECIFICS**

+ SNAPSHOTS TIME FRAME: AUG 15, 2021 - AUG 29, 2021
+ SNAPSHOTS ARE RETROSPECTIVE
+ SNAPSHOTS INCLUDE: ALL ADDRESSES AND CORRESPONDING TOKEN AMOUNT
+ ADDRESS WEIGHT = TOKEN AMOUNT / TOKEN CIRCULATION AMOUNT
+ MIN. ALLOCATION AMOUNT = 0.0001 GENESIS TOKEN 

## **"GENESIS" GAME** 

SEP, 2021

## **"GENESIS" ALLOCATION** 

+ "GENESIS" IS AN UTILITY TRANSITION TOKEN, IT HAS/WILL HAVE NO VALUE BY DEFAULT, NON LIQUID BY DEFAULT. 
+ "GENESIS" UTILITY TRANSITION TOKEN FUNCTION IS A NEW DECENTRALIZED BLOCKCHAIN BOOTSTRAPPING.
+ "GENESIS" TOKEN WILL BE ALLOCATED ONLY TO "PERSONAL" ADDRESSES.
+ NON "PERSONAL" ADDRESSES WEIGHT WILL BE ALLOCATED TO THE COMMUNITY MULTISIG ADDRESS (OR DAO)*
+ "GENESIS" ALLOCATION WILL HAPPEN IN SEPT, 2021 VIA TOKENCLAIM OR TOKENDROP
+ ALLOCATION TO DMT = 10M TOKENS * "PERSONAL" ADDRESS WEIGHT
+ ALLOCATION TO DKUMA = 10M TOKENS * "PERSONAL" ADDRESS WEIGHT
+ COMMUNITY (OR DAO) = 1M + (10M * NON "PERSONAL" DKUMA WEIGHT) + (10M * NON "PERSONAL" DMT WEIGHT)

*IN A FAVOR AND BENEFIT OF THE COMMUNITY AND FOR EXPERIMENT SUCCESS, AND QUALITY, FURTHER ALLOCATION TO BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPERS (GO, COSMOS, ETHERMINT, ETHEREUM, DAPPS, SOLIDITY, WEB3, CODE AUDITS AND OTHER), CUMULATIVE ADDRESSES WEIGHT OF NON "PERSONAL" ADDRESSES WILL BE ALLOCATED TO A MULTISIG ADDRESS CONTROLLED BY THE COMMUNITY (OR DAO). INCLUDING: TOKENS ON EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, TOKENS ON LIQUIDITY POOLS, AND ALL OTHER NON "PERSONAL" ADDRESSES. DEFAULT EXPERIMENT SETUP IS FOR PARTICIPANTS WITH OWN KEYS AND WEIGHTS OF NON "PERSONAL" SMART CONTRACTS WILL BE ALLOCATED TO PARTICIPANTS COMMUNITY FOR THEIR AND EXPERIMENT ADDITIONAL BENEFIT. 

** "Dust" (very small) amounts will not be counted to keep new blockchain setup clean. 

**EXAMPLE OF "GENESIS" ALLOCATION TO DMT/DKUMA ADDRESS**
 
    DMT HOLDINGS: 10 DMT
    ADDRESS WEIGHT: 10/9999 = 0.0010001
    "GENESIS" ALLOCATION: 10000000*0.0010001=10001

    DKUMA HOLDINGS: 10000 DKUMA
    ADDRESS APPROX. WEIGHT: 10000/120000000 = 0.000083333
    "GENESIS" ALLOCATION: 10000000*0.000083333 = 833.33

## **DKUMA & DMT SMART CONTRACTS**
